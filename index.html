    <h1>Git basics</h1>
    <h2>First commit has been created</h2>
    <div>How I did it<ul><li>
        git init  - for initialization in the project
    </li>
    <li>git config --local user.name "OlehKuts" - or global (instead local) for all future projects</li>
    <li>git config --local user.email - oleh.kuts@yahoo.com - email definition(without in quotes)</li>
    <li>git status - may use for checking status (untracked - indexed(added(for primary) or modified(for old files) - committed))</li>
    <li>git add -A - adding new files to pull (added)</li>
    <li>git commit -a -m"my first commit in this project" - m"info about this commit"</li></ul></div>
    <h2>Second commit has been created</h2>
    <li>git log - check info in terminal about all previous commits</li>
    <li>git remote add origin https://github.com/OlehKuts/Git_basics.git - copy from the new repository on GitHub
        - this move allows to tie local and github repositories
    </li>
    <li>git push -u origin master - (for first pushing)
         now we can add changes to remote github repository too (use word "master" instead "main")</li>
    <li>git push - it's enough for second and further pushes to GitHub repo</li>
    <li>git clone https://github.com/OlehKuts/Git_basics.git project_2 - 
        way to clone repo to another computer(project_2 - folder for cloning on the new device)    
    </li>
    <li>git pull - to get last changes which was done from others devices</li>
    <li>The frequent beginner error - by pushing - get error in terminal. 
        It occurs when somebody in the same project create and confirm changes which is not 
        uploaded on your PC(so you've working over old version of project) 
        So you have to apply command "git pull" and then try to push again
    </li>
